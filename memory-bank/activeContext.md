# Active Context - Angular Basic App

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Context Owner:** AI assistant (memory resets between sessions)

## Current Focus
- Memory Bank initialization for the Angular Basic project.
- Establishing baseline understanding of project purpose, architecture, and technology stack.

## Recent Changes
- Created the `memory-bank` directory with the core context files:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
- No code changes have been made to the Angular app itself as part of this initialization.

## Next Steps (General)
- When new tasks are requested, create corresponding entries under `memory-bank/tasks/`.
- Keep this `activeContext.md` updated with:
  - What feature or bug is currently being worked on.
  - Key decisions made during implementation.
  - Links/references to relevant task files.

## Notes & Considerations
- The user expects high accuracy and minimal mistakes.
- Always read **all** memory-bank core files at the start of each new task, then refresh `activeContext.md` and relevant task files as work progresses.
