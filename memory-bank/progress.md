# Progress - Angular Basic App

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17

## Current Status
- The Angular project structure is present and appears to be a working application with:
  - Core auth guards, interceptors, and services.
  - Login and dashboard features.
  - Public layout and shared UI components.
- Memory Bank has been initialized for this project.

## What Works (Inferred)
- Application compiles and builds (dist assets exist under `dist/angular-basic`).
- i18n JSON files for `en`, `ja`, and `vi` are present.
- Shared components (`Button`, `FormItem`, `TextInput`) and layouts (`public`) are implemented.

## What’s Left To Build (High-Level)
- To be refined per-task as new requests come in, for example:
  - Additional features or pages (beyond login/dashboard).
  - Enhancements to auth flow, error handling, or validation.
  - UX/UI improvements and additional shared components.

## Known Issues / Unknowns
- No explicit issue list yet; this will be updated as tasks reveal bugs or missing features.
